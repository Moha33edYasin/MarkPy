# String Theory

    this is a very good attempt to unify the natural forces:
        - Gravity (The hassle one!)
            - The story of an apple nailing a man's forehead.
                - Cause our the biggest problem; the others are okey.
        - Electromagnetic force
            - when electric fields dance with magnetic ones
        - Strong nuclear
            - I don't excatly know, but it relate to nuclear particals.
        - Weak nuclear
            - same here.

## The good news are:
    And at least, it make it for a universe with 11 dimension.
Physicists and mathematician are trying to fit it wit context of our observable universe
this what is so-call: ** Everything theory **
