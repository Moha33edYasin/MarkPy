# String Theory

    This is a very good attempt to unify the natural forces:
        - Gravity (The hassle one!)
            - The story of an apple nailing a man's forehead.
                - It actually the biggest stone in the way; the others are okey.
        - Electromagnetic force
            - When electric fields dance with magnetic ones.
        - Strong nuclear
            - I don't excatly know what it is, but it relates to the nuclear particals.
        - Weak nuclear
            - same here.

## The good news are:
    At least, it make it for a universe with 11 dimension.
Physicists and mathematician are trying to use some witty and perhaps Potter's magic wand to fit the theory to the context of our observable universe in what they so-called it: ** Everything theory **
